\textbf{Logistic}\\
Here we first train the logistic parameters. And we found in 1-gram we got the maximum accuracy rate with C = 7 (or 8) and 2-gram we accuracy rate converge when C goes larger so we set C= 199. By running approximately 1000 secs, we got accuracy rate of 0.9331 for 1-gram and 0.9384 for 2-gram. This is a method with decent running time (cost) and  good accuracy rate.
