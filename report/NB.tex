\textbf{Naive Bayes}\\
Naive Bayes has a very strong assumption that components of the vector x are independent in each class. However, in this data set, we may easily think of the situation that words are related to each other. So in this case, we will not expect Naive Bayes to perform better than other methods. And we found out that the accuracy rate of Naive Bayes has the lowest accuracy rate: 0.7304 for 1-gram and 0.7281 for 2-gram.
