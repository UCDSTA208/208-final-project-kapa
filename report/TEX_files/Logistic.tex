Here we first trained the logistic parameters. By tuning the parameters from 1 to 200, we found out that uni-gram tfidf has the maximum accuracy rate with C = 7 (or 8) and the accuracy rate of bi-gram converges when C goes larger. Therefore, we set C= 199. By running approximately 1000 secs, we got accuracy rate of 0.9320 for uni-gram and 0.9384 for bi-gram. This is a method with decent running time (cost) and good accuracy rate. \\
