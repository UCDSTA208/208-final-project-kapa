When fitting KNN models, we tune the parameters with three candidate of K including 3, 5, and 7. The running time is much longer comparing to decision tree. For unit-gram tfidf, the running time for predicting testing data is 457, 441, 494 for each K respectively. After tuning the parameter, the best K for unit-gram tfidf is K=3. The accuracy rate is 0.9657. When using bi-gram tfidf to fit the models, the best K is also 3 with the accuracy rate 0.9678. Using bi-gram in KNN model will improve our prediciton. Table \ref{Confusion_KNN} showed the confusion matrix of KNN model with both unit-gram and bi-gram tfidf. Comparing the mis-classification rate for each class, when the observations are ham email, we will have high probability to have wrong prediction.\\
